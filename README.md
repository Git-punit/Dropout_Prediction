# Student Dropout Prediction System

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Student Dropout Prediction System** is a machine learning project designed to predict whether a student is likely to **drop out** based on academic performance and attendance data.

This project helps educational institutions:
- Identify at-risk students early
- Take preventive actions
- Improve retention and academic outcomes

It is highly relevant to **Digital India education initiatives** and analytics use cases such as the **Academic Bank of Credits (ABC)**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze student academic data
- Build a machine learning model to predict dropout risk
- Support data-driven intervention strategies
- Demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load student data from CSV  
2. Perform train-test split  
3. Train Random Forest model  
4. Evaluate model accuracy  
5. Display prediction performance
